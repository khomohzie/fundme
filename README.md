# fundme
This is a blockchain improvement on the startup 'Kickstarter'. Well thought out features, control and security.

### Why Fundme is different
A major disadvantage of Kickstarter is removing the power from the hands of funders as to how their money is finally spent on the execution of a project. A challenge that Fundme solves by introducing consensus on the blockchain.

Fundme uses a voting based system to ensure that contributors have a say, to an extent as to if the money should spent or not.

### How it works?
The project owner creates a request each time they want to spend some money and give a reason for that request (what they want to spend the money on). Contributors or funders can then vote to approve that request.
